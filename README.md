### Educational project. [ `REACT` | `SASS` | `VITE`]

<br>
I created this site using REACT, SASS and VITE during my fourth month of study.<br>
This is an unfinished version of a streaming platform made to familiarize with React.<br>
<br>

> [!NOTE] 
> My skills have improved since the day I made this site.<br>
> There are mistakes I could have corrected, but I chose not to on purpose.<br>
> In this way I intend to keep a history of my progress.<br>
